"""A Destruction Contract whose destruction happens many trigger hops away.

A particle carrying two destructors (d1, d2) is passed down a long chain of
Action Executions and destroyed at the bottom, where both destructors fire with
unmet requirements (p1 is filled, so d1's empty-requirement is violated; p2 is
emptied, so d2's occupied-requirement is violated). The chain must trace every
trigger hop from the verifying definition down to the destruction, the same way
ordinary requirement propagation does.
